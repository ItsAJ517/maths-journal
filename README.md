# maths-journal

Hi there! This repository is a personal record of how I'm learning to solve challenging maths problems - especially those from UKMT and Olympiad-style competitions.

This journal helps me reflect on how I approah problems, learn from mistakes, and recognise patterns in mathematical thinking. My goals are to:

    Get better at solving unfamiliar problems
    Prepare for maths competitions and future interviews

In this journal, you will find content such as:

    Mistake logs
    Strategy notes
    Example problems

Resources I use:

- [UKMT Past Papers](https://www.ukmt.org.uk/past-papers)
