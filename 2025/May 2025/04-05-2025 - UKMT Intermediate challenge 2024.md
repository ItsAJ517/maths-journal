Questions which I found hard:

- Q3
  - The key trick was to spot triangle PRQ and TRQ were the same.
  - I didn't spot this because I didn't spot the fact that since they have the same base and perpendicular height.
  - Next time I will try to spot different shapes in the diagram.

- Q9
  - I didn't use the radii of the sectors of the circle to form an equation.
  - Next time I will try to examine each part of the diagram carefully.

- Q15
  - Although I formed simultaneous equations, I didn't form the correct ones.
  - I had some negative variables in my simultaneous equations, which made them harder to solve. This is because I kept all the variables to one side and numbers to the other.
  - Next time I will make sure my simultaneous equations only have positive variables.
