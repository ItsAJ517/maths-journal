Questions which I struggled with:

- Q3
  - The key trick was to spot triangle PRQ and TRQ were the same.
  - I didn't spot this because I didn't realize they have the same base and perpendicular height.

- Q9
  - I didn't use the radii of the sectors of the circle to form an equation.

- Q15
  - Although I formed simultaneous equations, I didn't form the correct ones.
  - I had some negative variables in my simultaneous equations, which made them harder to solve. This is because I kept all the variables to one side and numbers to the other.

- Q19
  - The trick was to label each empty square with a letter. After that, you can use equations and logical reasoning to find the answer.

- Q21
  - The trick was to draw a square to prove the symmetry of the figure, and then forming an equation to find he shaded area.

- Q23
  - In this question, I correctly drew two right-angled triangles using points P, A, and O.
  - After that, I had to prove that they were congruent, which I was unable to figure out.


Overall, my main weaknesses were in the following topics:

    Geometry diagrams
    Forming equations
