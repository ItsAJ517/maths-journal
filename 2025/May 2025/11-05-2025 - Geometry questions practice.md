In the past week, I practiced questions 1-11 on this PDF: https://www.drfrost.org/uploads/users/1/r209/IMC-Geometry.pdf

Key questions:

- Q1
  - I got this question correct as I drew different lines on the diagram to identify different shapes and find different side lengths

- Q6
  - Although I got this question wrong, I was extremely close to finding the correct answer.
  - I didn't spot that PQT was an isosceles right-angled triangle, from where I would've found the base angles and ultimately angle PQR.
